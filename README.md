This is a repository to work with the IIPC data that is provided by Archive-it

Be carefull, at the root of this repository, once cloned, is supposed to be a folder 'data' with the files that you can download from Archive-it. I am not putting them here, because I am not sure I have the right too and because they are too big.

in the folder 'generated', you will find some generated files, especially pivot tables to assess the biases of the corpus.
